# Microlending-Fee-Optimizer

This repository contains an IPython Notebook I created for my Insight Data Science (www.insightdatascience.com) project that I completed in three weeks. I worked with an online nonprofit microlending company during this period, and the specific goal of the project was to help the nonprofit choose a fee they call the "loan loss reserve fee" to be used in the new business model they have recently adopted. Basically, instead of paying interest, first-time borrowers will pay this one-time fee that goes to a reserve fund which is used for compensating lenders for default losses. 

Predictive modeling of losses from loans was performed with a Random Forest model that used pre-disbursement features as well as features that reflected the current repayment behavior. Validation was carried out on an independent test set which yielded a predicted-R<sup>2</sup> of 0.70.
